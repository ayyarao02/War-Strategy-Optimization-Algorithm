# War-Strategy-Optimization-Algorithm
The proposed War Strategy Optimization (WSO) is based on the strategic movement of army troops during the war. War strategy is modeled as an optimization process wherein each soldier dynamically moves towards the optimum value. The proposed algorithm models two popular war strategies, attack and defense strategies.
